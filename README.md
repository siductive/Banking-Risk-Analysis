# Banking-Risk-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Banking Dataset

# Project Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a banking dataset to uncover key insights about customer financial behavior. By analyzing deposits, savings, income levels, and banking habits, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of customer trends and correlations.

# Dataset

The dataset contains various banking-related attributes, including:

Bank Deposits

Saving Accounts

Superannuation

Checking Balances

Property Ownership

Business and Personal Lending

Estimated Income

Age

# Key Insights

ðŸ”¹ Deposits and Savings Behavior

A high correlation between Bank Deposits and Saving Accounts suggests that these features may measure overlapping financial behaviors.

Customers who actively deposit funds also tend to maintain or grow their savings balances.

ðŸ”¹ Income, Age, and Accumulation

Moderate correlations between Age & Estimated Income with Superannuation, Savings, and Checking Balances reflect a common financial lifecycle pattern.

Higher-income earners and older individuals accumulate more savings, build larger retirement funds, and may also have higher credit card balances or loans.

ðŸ”¹ Low Correlation with Property Ownership

Property ownership depends on external factors like real estate market conditions, location, and inheritance, which are not captured by banking variables.

This results in weaker correlations between property ownership and other banking metrics.

ðŸ”¹ Business vs. Personal Banking

Moderate correlation between Business Lending and Bank Loans suggests that some customers have both personal and business debts.

However, business lending is relatively uncorrelated with other deposit or property-related metrics, indicating that business banking serves a distinct customer segment.
